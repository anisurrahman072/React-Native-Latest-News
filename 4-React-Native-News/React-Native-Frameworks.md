# React Native Frameworks

Hey React Native Developers,

One of the biggest and most exciting conferences on **React Native**, organized by [**Software Mansion**](https://x.com/swmansion) with [**Expo**](https://x.com/expo) as the main partner and [notJust.dev](https://www.notjust.dev/) as the Media Partner among others, has recently concluded. The three-day event started on May 22nd, filled with exciting announcements. Letâ€™s dive in ðŸš€

[**Nicola Corti**](https://x.com/cortinico) from **Metaâ€™s React Native team** clarified on stage the key responsibilities of **React Native core** and **React Native frameworks**. He also recalled a quote from **React Conf 2024**.

### React Native Core VS Frameworks

The **core** refers to the React Native SDK (latest version 0.74), and **React Native frameworks** are the toolbox with all the necessary APIs to let you build production-ready apps. (Ex: Expo). **Nicola** presented a clear and detailed chart of the responsibilities of these two modules.

In the image above, you see two parts: the **Frameworks** (top section) and the **Core** (bottom section), each with the features they must provide. He also mentioned that **Expo** (a React Native framework) provides all the features specified in the above image (top section), which is why the official React Native documentation now recommends using **Expo** as a React Native framework.

Side by side he mentioned two methods for building a library for React Native.

1. Build a library for React native **Framework** (Ex: For Expo)
2. Build a library for React Native **Core** (Ex: TurboModules)

### Rules of React Native Frameworks

Although **Expo** exists, if anyone wishes to create a **React Native Framework** and have it recommended by the official React Native team, they must follow certain rules as shown below. Nicola primarily emphasized one point: **â€˜Do not fork the react-native core to create a React Native Framework.â€™**

### When to build a new React Native Framework?

The React Native core team has recommended these use cases for when you can build your own React Native Framework, only if youâ€™re:

1. **Pro**Â at native development and needs something unique that other frameworks donâ€™t offer.
2. **A React Native expert** and want to adjust it to suit your companyâ€™s way of doing things.
3. **Aiming**Â to adapt React Native for new platforms, like visionOS.
4. **A company**Â that has special needs, like legal or licensing issues, that prevent using available frameworks.
