# React Native for Apple Vision Pro

Another piece of good news is that [**Michal**](https://x.com/thymikee) from [**Callstack**](https://x.com/callstackio) has introduced the React world to the [**`react-native-visionos`**](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-visionos) SDK for Apple Vision Pro. It’s a great contribution from [Oskar](https://x.com/o_kwasniewski), who has conducted very thorough research on it over the past few months 💯.

### React Native VisionOS

React Native visionOS is an out-of-tree platform that forks from the React Native core, extending its possibilities to new platforms. Examples of such projects include [React Native Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows), [React Native macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos), and [React Native tvOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos).

### Start with Apple Vision Pro using React Native

You don’t need an Apple Vision Pro to make apps; using a simulator is enough. To create a new project you can use the React Native Community CLI:

```bash
npx @callstack/react-native-visionos@latest init NotJustDevVisionApp
```

### Live Demo

[**Michal**](https://x.com/thymikee) presented a live demo in which he loaded a 3D element with an impressive space background, powered by JavaScript, React Native Gesture Handler, and React Native Reanimated. 🚀
